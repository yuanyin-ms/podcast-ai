Elizabeth Gilbert asked this question, and it's one of life's most profound queries. The history of human creativity is like an attempt to answer it, you know, through art, poetry, and philosophy.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"Oh, that's a deep thought! It really makes you ponder. So, who else has something to say about this?\"},{\"speaker\":\"A\",\"text\":\"Well, Nietzsche did. He believed embracing difficulty is key for a fulfilling life. In 1873, when he was about to turn 30, he wrote an essay called Schopenhauer as Educator. In it, he addressed how we can find ourselves and bring out our gifts.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"Wow, Nietzsche always has some profound insights. What did he say exactly?\"},{\"speaker\":\"A\",\"text\":\"He said that anyone who doesn't want to be part of the masses should stop taking the easy way out. They should follow their conscience that says, 'Be yourself! All that you're doing, thinking, and desiring that isn't you, let it go.' Every young soul hears this call and gets excited about the potential happiness.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"That's so true! But it's easier said than done, right? How can one really achieve this?\"},{\"speaker\":\"A\",\"text\":\"Yeah, it's not easy. Nietzsche pointed out that as long as a soul is chained by opinions and fears, it can't reach that happiness. And life can be so hopeless without self - liberation. He also said no one can build the bridge for you to cross the river of life. You have to find your own path and just start walking.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"Oh, I get it. It's like Picasso said, you have to start drawing to know what you're going to draw. But finding oneself must be a tough journey, right?\"},{\"speaker\":\"A\",\"text\":\"Absolutely! Nietzsche said it's a dark and mysterious business. It's like peeling off layers of skin, and you might hurt yourself in the process. But he also gave a method. Young souls should think about what they've truly loved, and those things might reveal the fundamental law of themselves.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"That's an interesting approach. So, what about the role of education in all this?\"},{\"speaker\":\"A\",\"text\":\"Nietzsche said true educators are liberators. They help you access the original sense of your being. They're like removing weeds, rubble, and pests, and providing light, warmth, and rain for your growth. It's not about giving artificial things.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"That's a beautiful way to describe education. So, how can we use this to find ourselves?\"},{\"speaker\":\"A\",\"text\":\"Nietzsche concluded that reflecting on one's educators and cultivators is one of the best ways to wake up from the 'anesthesia' we're in and find ourselves. There might be other methods, but he thought this one was great.\"},{\"speaker\":\"B\",\"text\":\"Well, that's some really profound wisdom from Nietzsche. It gives us a lot to think about, eh?\"}]}",
